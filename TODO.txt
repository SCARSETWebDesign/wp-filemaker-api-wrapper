setup bootstrap etc b/c will require php5
setup classes folder etc like your other oo/mvc plugins?

add options page
	for email addresses instead of constant
	connection statsus field, shows error msg if can't connect
	all connection info, except for password, still leave that in db
	can leave database field empty if working w/ multiple databases. just make sure you select db in your code before running queries

add support for choosing between fx.php and offical api
	can't bundle either b/c not gpl, so have to give instructions to manually install
	add radio button to options page to choose which package is used
		or maybe have code auto-detect based on which files exist

add filters everywhere

add to wporg repo
	maybe remove from github at this point
